#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.
Importance in the Technology Industry: Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programming languages
2. establishment of software engineering as a discipline
3. advent of structured programming
4. rise of agile methodologies

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  - Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach. Each phase, such as requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance, is completed before the next begins. This method works well in projects with well-defined requirements, where changes are unlikely.

Example scenario: Developing a medical device where strict regulatory compliance requires detailed documentation and testing. The Waterfall model allows for comprehensive planning and is suitable for projects where outcomes must be clearly defined from the start.

Agile, on the other hand, is an iterative and incremental approach. Teams work in short cycles, or sprints, allowing for regular feedback and adaptation. Agile emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and quick responses to change, making it ideal for projects where requirements evolve over time.

Example scenario: A software development project for a healthcare app where features need regular updates based on user feedback. Agileâ€™s iterative nature enables the team to respond to new requirements and improve the app continuously.

Comparison:

Flexibility: Agile is more adaptable, while Waterfall is rigid.
Planning: Waterfall requires detailed upfront planning; Agile evolves with each iteration.
Feedback: Agile encourages regular feedback; Waterfall waits until the end for review.
Cost of Change: Changes in Agile are less costly, whereas they are more expensive and complex in Waterfall.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  - Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
  - Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
  - Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide tools for coding, debugging, and testing in one platform. Examples like Visual Studio and Eclipse support multiple languages, streamline development, and reduce errors with features like code completion and syntax highlighting.

VCS track code changes and manage team contributions. Git and Subversion (SVN) help developers collaborate, avoid conflicts, and roll back changes if needed, essential for teamwork and code history.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
changing requirements- This can be avoided by proper planning before the software is put to development
tight deadlines- This can be avoided by timely planning and request of software development
technical debt- can be avoided by giving developers enough time in order to follow due process


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  - Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is designing prompts to guide AI models for accurate, relevant responses. It improves clarity, efficiency, and customization, aligning AI outputs with user goals and needs, especially in complex fields, enhancing the overall AI interaction experience.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about law."

Improved Prompt: "Explain the difference between civil and criminal law in the U.S., focusing on their purposes and examples."

Explanation: The improved prompt is more effective because it specifies the area of law, the type of information requested, and narrows down to the U.S. This focus reduces ambiguity and guides the AI to provide a relevant, detailed response.
